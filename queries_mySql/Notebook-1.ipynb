However, this listing is not about EV muscle cars but rather about old-school, mechanical to the core, vintage muscle cars. The Dodge Division of Chrysler Motors first produced the Dart model as a line of large passenger cars. As the generations passed and the Dart options list lengthened, it joined a new and smaller breed of American muscle cars. The year 1969 saw the addition of the Dart Swinger 340 and it was the best by far. This is your chance to own one with a full frame off restoration.
